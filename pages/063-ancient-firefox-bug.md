### Case: The Ancient Firefox Bug

<!-- 23-year old Yifan Zhu fixes a bug in Firefox that hasn't been properly addressed for 22 years (because it's not critical), no experience in projects as complicated as Firefox

This gives room like us newer junior engineers to put our foot into real, complicated software and gradually learn about how it is built

The fix is literally just to check whether the browser is in focus (the "main" window) at the moment to decide whether to show the tooltip or not -->
